VictorySound addon for DBM

DBM-VictorySound

That is right, I'm now working on version 2.0 of DBM-VictorySound.  This release is dedicated first to fix the addon due to changes by within WoW and DBM.

Features:

1) Fully configurable within the GUI.  No code editing to play your own music.  UI integrates with existing DBM UI.

2) Comes pre-loaded with a small selection of music.  You can add your own by dropping sounds into the Sounds directory and restarting World of Warcraft. Type the sound file name in the appropriate text box in the options.

3) Provides music when the encounter starts, also plays a sound when you defeat the boss or it defeats you.

4) Misc stuff.


You can forcibly stop the music by typing /killvs.  I plan on adding features that will also kill the music if you drop combat.
